# Cake Calc Web App

## Description

This is a Vanilla JavaScript application developed for learning purposes. The app is designed for bakers and helps calculate the price of a cake, advance payment, and determine the size of the baking pan needed to bake the sponge for the cake. It takes inputs such as the price per person, the number of people, the cake shape, whether the order includes a cake box, whether it's gluten-free, and any additional charges. By entering customer information, the app provides output information to be fast communicated to the customer during the cake ordering process, as well as internal information for the bakery.

## Features

- Calculate the total price of the cake based on the price per person and the number of people.
- Calculate the required deposit amount based on the specified percentage.
